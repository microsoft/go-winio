	// We use the Windows API GetFinalPathNameByHandle to handle path resolution. GetFinalPathNameByHandle
	// returns a resolved path name for a file or directory. The returned path can be in several different
	// formats, based on the flags passed. There are several goals behind the design here:
	// - Do as little manual path manipulation as possible. Since Windows path formatting can be quite
	//   complex, we try to just let the Windows APIs handle that for us.
	// - Retain as much compatibility with existing Go path functions as we can. In particular, we try to
	//   ensure paths returned from resolvePath can be passed to EvalSymlinks.
	//
	// First, we query for the VOLUME_NAME_GUID path of the file. This will return a path in the form
	// "\\?\Volume{8a25748f-cf34-4ac6-9ee2-c89400e886db}\dir\file.txt". If the path is a UNC share
	// (e.g. "\\server\share\dir\file.txt"), then the VOLUME_NAME_GUID query will fail with ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND.
	// In this case, we will next try a VOLUME_NAME_DOS query. This query will return a path for a UNC share
	// in the form "\\?\UNC\server\share\dir\file.txt". This path will work with most functions, but EvalSymlinks
	// fails on it. Therefore, we rewrite the path to the form "\\server\share\dir\file.txt" before returning it.
	// This path rewrite may not be valid in all cases (see the notes in the next paragraph), but those should
	// be very rare edge cases, and this case wouldn't have worked with EvalSymlinks anyways.
	//
	// The "\\?\" prefix indicates that no path parsing or normalization should be performed by Windows.
	// Instead the path is passed directly to the object manager. The lack of parsing means that "." and ".." are
	// interpreted literally and "\"" must be used as a path separator. Additionally, because normalization is
	// not done, certain paths can only be represented in this format. For instance, "\\?\C:\foo." (with a trailing .)
	// cannot be written as "C:\foo.", because path normalization will remove the trailing ".".
	//
	// We use FILE_NAME_OPENED instead of FILE_NAME_NORMALIZED, as FILE_NAME_NORMALIZED can fail on some
	// UNC paths based on access restrictions. The additional normalization done is also quite minimal in
	// most cases.
	//
	// Querying for VOLUME_NAME_DOS first instead of VOLUME_NAME_GUID would yield a "nicer looking" path in some cases.
	// For instance, it could return "\\?\C:\dir\file.txt" instead of "\\?\Volume{8a25748f-cf34-4ac6-9ee2-c89400e886db}\dir\file.txt".
	// However, we query for VOLUME_NAME_GUID first for two reasons:
	// - The volume GUID path is more stable. A volume's mount point can change when it is remounted, but its
	//   volume GUID should not change.
	// - If the volume is mounted at a non-drive letter path (e.g. mounted to "C:\mnt"), then VOLUME_NAME_DOS
	//   will return the mount path. EvalSymlinks fails on a path like this due to a bug.
